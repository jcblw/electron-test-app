This is a small test app built on [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron). The client portion of the app is build in [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html).

## Install

```shell
git clone git@github.com:jcblw/electron-test-app.git
```

To install the dependencies do.

```shell
npm install
```

## Running App

```shell
npm start
```

## Dev

So for install dependecies for your Electron app you need to install those in the `app/` directory. If you are trying to use a native module right now you can do this by doing `MODULE=module_name npm run nativeinstall`. This is not yet fully tested tho.
